                <p>Satisfactory white bread can be made from flour, water, salt, and yeast. (A “sourdough” addition may be substituted for commercial yeast.) Yeast-raised breads based on this simple mixture include Italian-style bread and French or Vienna breads.</p>

                <p>Olive bread is a bread laced with olives. It originated in Italy, where it is prepared using black salt-cured olives, green Spanish-style olives, and other types. Italian varieties are typically prepared with flour, butter and eggs as the bread's base.</p>

                <p>In addition to wheat, whole grain bread can include other whole grains, such as whole barley, brown rice, whole grain oats, and rolled oats, among others (all of which are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals).</p>

                <p>While most bread has a fairly high water content (usually around 40 percent), the water content of baguettes is much higher — usually about 50 percent. That gives baguettes their light and airy texture, which also means they dry out quickly.</p>
